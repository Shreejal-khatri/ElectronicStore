ElectronicStore is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The purpose of this project is to design and implement an online electronics store that allows users to view and interact with electronic products through a web-based interface. The frontend of the application is built using React.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience, while the backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and RESTful API communication. MongoDB is used as the database to store product, user, and order information. The system supports core e-commerce functionalities such as product listing, cart management, user authentication, and order placement, demonstrating the practical implementation of full-stack web development concepts.
